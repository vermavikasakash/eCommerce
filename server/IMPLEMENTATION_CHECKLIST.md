## 📋 Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Start all services with `npm run dev`
- [ ] Check all services are running on correct ports
- [ ] Test API Gateway health: `curl http://localhost:8080/health`
- [ ] Test Product Service: `curl http://localhost:8081/health`
- [ ] Test Cart Service: `curl http://localhost:8082/health`
- [ ] Test Order Service: `curl http://localhost:8083/health`
- [ ] Test Payment Service: `curl http://localhost:8084/health`

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Fetch products via gateway: `GET /api/products`
- [ ] Add item to cart via gateway: `POST /api/cart/items`
- [ ] Get cart via gateway: `GET /api/cart`
- [ ] Update cart item: `PATCH /api/cart/items/1`
- [ ] Remove cart item: `DELETE /api/cart/items/1`
- [ ] Create order: `POST /api/orders`
- [ ] List orders: `GET /api/orders`
- [ ] Check payment provider: `GET /api/payments/provider`

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Cart can fetch products from Product Service
- [ ] Order can fetch cart from Cart Service
- [ ] Order can process payment from Payment Service
- [ ] Cart clears after successful order
- [ ] Error handling works across services

### Docker Testing
- [ ] Build containers: `docker-compose up --build`
- [ ] All containers start successfully
- [ ] Services communicate with each other
- [ ] Gateway routes requests correctly

## 🔄 Service Dependencies Flow

```
Product Service (8081)
  ↓
Cart Service (8082) - depends on Product Service
  ├─ Validates products
  └─ Calculates totals

Order Service (8083) - depends on Cart & Payment Services
  ├─ Fetches cart
  ├─ Processes payment
  └─ Clears cart

Payment Service (8084) - independent
  └─ Processes charges

API Gateway (8080) - depends on all services
  └─ Routes requests
```

## 📊 Request Flow Examples

### Flow 1: Get Products
```
Client → Gateway → Product Service → Client
```

### Flow 2: Add to Cart
```
Client → Gateway → Cart Service → Product Service → Cart Service → Client
```

### Flow 3: Create Order
```
Client → Gateway → Order Service ├→ Cart Service → Client
                                 ├→ Payment Service
                                 └→ Cart Service (clear)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Install and start all services
npm install
npm run dev

# Or start individually
npm run gateway
npm run product-service
npm run cart-service
npm run order-service
npm run payment-service
```

- [ ] Add database connection pooling

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Message queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka)
- [ ] Service discovery
- [ ] Real-time notifications (Socket.io)
- [ ] Load balancing
- [ ] Caching layer (Redis)

### Phase 4: Production Ready
- [ ] Logging and monitoring
- [ ] API documentation (Swagger)
- [ ] Authentication service
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] Security hardening

### Phase 5: Optimization
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Database optimization
- [ ] Cache strategies
- [ ] CDN integration

## 📝 Notes

1. **Customer Context**: All requests include `x-customer-id` for multi-tenancy
2. **Error Handling**: Centralized error handler in shared middleware
3. **Async/Await**: All async operations properly wrapped
4. **CORS**: Configured for local development
5. **Health Checks**: All services have `/health` endpoint
6. **Scalability**: Ready for containerization and orchestration

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- [ ] Add JWT authentication
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Validate all inputs
- [ ] Use HTTPS in production
- [ ] Secure inter-service communication
- [ ] Environment variable encryption
- [ ] Database credential management

## ✨ Key Achievements

This microservices conversion provides:
1. **Independence**: Each service can scale independently
2. **Flexibility**: Different technologies per service
3. **Resilience**: Failure in one service doesn't crash others
4. **Team Autonomy**: Different teams can work on different services
5. **Easier Testing**: Services can be tested in isolation
6. **Continuous Deployment**: Deploy services independently
7. **Clear Responsibilities**: Each service has a single concern
